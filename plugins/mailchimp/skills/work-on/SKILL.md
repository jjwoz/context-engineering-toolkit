# Work On

Start working on a Jira ticket by gathering all relevant context (ticket details, related branches, recent PRs) before taking action.

## Overview
Provides comprehensive context about a ticket including its current status, related git branches, recent PRs, and sprint membership. After displaying context, presents interactive options to create a branch, move the ticket status, or just use the context for awareness.

**Default:** Context display with interactive action menu.

## Usage

### By ticket key:
```
/work-on PROJ-1234
```

### By full Jira URL:
```
/work-on https://jira.intuit.com/browse/PROJ-1234
```

### Interactive mode (no params):
```
/work-on
```
Prompts for ticket key or URL.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `ticket` | Yes* | Ticket key (PROJ-1234) or full Jira URL |

*Required unless using interactive mode

## Steps

### 1. Parse input and extract ticket key
- **If no params provided**: Enter interactive mode
  - Prompt: "Enter ticket key or Jira URL:"
  - Examples: "PROJ-1234", "https://jira.intuit.com/browse/PROJ-1234"
- **If ticket provided**: Extract ticket key
  - Support both `PROJ-1234` format and full URL
  - Validate format matches `[A-Z]+-\d+`
  - Example: Extract "PROJ-1234" from URL
- If invalid format:
  - Show error: "❌ Invalid ticket format. Expected: PROJ-1234 or full Jira URL"
  - Exit

### 1b. PR Pace check

Before fetching ticket details, load or refresh the PR pace state and emit a nudge:

> **PR Pace check:** Load or refresh `/tmp/pr-pace-state.json` per `.agent/skills/pr-pace/SKILL.md` Step 1. Emit the pace nudge (Step 2) as a markdown blockquote before the ticket summary. Skip silently if `gh` is unavailable.

### 2. Authenticate with Jira
- Call `eiam_login()` to get user credentials
- Store `userId` and `userTicket` for subsequent calls

### 3. Fetch ticket details
- Call `jira_search_issues(issueKeys=[ticket])`
- Extract key information:
  - Summary
  - Status
  - Assignee
  - Description (first 200 chars for context)
  - Story points
  - Priority
  - Epic (if linked)
  - Sprint information (if in sprint)
- If ticket not found:
  - Show error: "❌ Ticket {key} not found or not accessible"
  - Suggest: "Check ticket exists at https://jira.intuit.com/browse/{key}"
  - Exit

### 4. Check sprint membership
- If ticket has sprint data in response:
  - Identify active sprint(s)
  - Extract sprint name and dates
  - Calculate sprint progress (days elapsed/total)
- If in active sprint:
  - Flag prominently: "📅 In active sprint: {sprint_name} (Day {X}/{Y})"
- If not in sprint or sprint closed:
  - Note: "⚠️ Not in current sprint"

### 5. Search for related local branches
- Run: `git branch -a --list "*{ticket}*"`
- Parse results:
  - Local branches: `PROJ-1234-feature-name`
  - Remote branches: `origin/PROJ-1234-feature-name`
- Group results:
  - Current branch (if matches)
  - Other local branches
  - Remote-only branches
- For each branch, get metadata:
  - Last commit date: `git log -1 --format="%cr" {branch}`
  - Last commit message: `git log -1 --format="%s" {branch}`
  - Ahead/behind main: `git rev-list --left-right --count main...{branch}`
- Sort by most recently updated

### 6. Search for related PRs
- Run: `gh pr list --search "{ticket} in:title" --state all --limit 10 --json number,title,state,url,author,createdAt,closedAt`
- Filter to last 2 weeks:
  - Calculate cutoff: `today - 14 days`
  - Filter PRs where `createdAt >= cutoff OR closedAt >= cutoff`
- Group by state:
  - Open PRs (highest priority)
  - Recently merged PRs (within 2 weeks)
  - Recently closed PRs (within 2 weeks)
- For each PR, extract:
  - PR number and title
  - Author
  - State (Open/Merged/Closed)
  - Created date (relative, e.g., "3 days ago")
  - Closed/merged date if applicable
- Sort: Open first, then by most recent activity

### 7. Display consolidated context
Format output as clear, scannable markdown:

```markdown
📋 {TICKET}: {Summary}

Status: {status} | Assignee: {assignee} | Story Points: {points} | Priority: {priority}

{Sprint info if applicable}

Description:
{First 200 chars of description}...
[View full: https://jira.intuit.com/browse/{TICKET}]

{Epic info if applicable}

---

🌿 Related Branches ({count}):
{If current branch matches}
  ✓ {branch_name} (current branch)
    Last commit: {message} ({time_ago})
    Status: {X commits ahead, Y commits behind main}

{Other local branches}
  • {branch_name}
    Last commit: {message} ({time_ago})
    Status: {X commits ahead, Y commits behind main}

{Remote-only branches}
  ◦ {branch_name} (remote only)
    Last commit: {message} ({time_ago})

{If no branches found}
  No related branches found

---

🔀 Recent PRs ({count} in last 2 weeks):
{Open PRs}
  🟢 #{number} {title} (Open)
     by {author} • opened {time_ago}
     {url}

{Recently merged PRs}
  ✅ #{number} {title} (Merged)
     by {author} • merged {time_ago}
     {url}

{Recently closed PRs}
  ⚫ #{number} {title} (Closed)
     by {author} • closed {time_ago}
     {url}

{If no PRs found}
  No related PRs in last 2 weeks

---
```

### 8. Present action menu
After displaying context, show interactive options:

```markdown
What would you like to do?

1. Create new branch from latest main
2. Checkout existing branch: {branch_name} (if branches exist)
3. Move ticket to "In Progress" (if not already)
4. View full ticket details (description, acceptance criteria, comments)
5. Nothing - just needed the context

Your choice (1-5):
```

**Menu logic:**
- Option 1: Always available
- Option 2: Only show if related branches exist
  - If multiple branches, show submenu to select which one
  - If current branch matches ticket, note: "(already checked out)"
- Option 3: Only show if ticket not already "In Progress"
  - If already "In Progress", change to "View available transitions"
- Option 4: Always available
- Option 5: Always available

### 9. Handle user selection

#### Option 1: Create new branch
- Prompt: "Enter brief branch description (e.g., 'add-user-dashboard'):"
- Validate input:
  - Convert to kebab-case
  - Remove special characters except hyphens
  - Limit to 50 chars
- Suggested format: `{TICKET}-{description}`
  - Example: `PROJ-1234-add-user-dashboard`
- Confirm with user: "Create branch: {branch_name}? (y/n)"
- If confirmed:
  - Ensure on latest main: `git fetch origin && git checkout main && git pull origin main`
  - Create branch: `git checkout -b {branch_name}`
  - Show: "✅ Created and checked out branch: {branch_name}"
- After branch creation, ask: "Move ticket to 'In Progress'? (y/n)"

#### Option 2: Checkout existing branch
- If multiple branches:
  - Show submenu:
    ```
    Select branch:
    1. {branch_1}
    2. {branch_2}
    ...
    
    Your choice (1-N):
    ```
- Checkout selected branch: `git checkout {branch_name}`
- Check if branch is behind main:
  - If behind: Show warning: "⚠️ Branch is {N} commits behind main. Consider rebasing."
  - Offer: "Rebase onto latest main? (y/n)"
- Show: "✅ Checked out branch: {branch_name}"

#### Option 3: Move ticket to "In Progress"
- Call `getTransitionsForJiraIssue(cloudId, issueIdOrKey=ticket, expand="transitions.fields")` — find the "In Progress" transition ID and discover any required screen fields upfront
- Confirm: "Move {TICKET} from {current_status} to In Progress? (y/n)"
- If confirmed:
  1. **Populate required fields:** For each required field on the transition screen, use a sensible default (e.g., `0` for numeric fields, current user's account ID for assignee/user fields)
  2. **Transition:** Call `transitionJiraIssue(cloudId, issueIdOrKey=ticket, transition={id}, fields={...required_fields})`
  3. **Verify success:** Call `getJiraIssue(cloudId, issueIdOrKey=ticket)` and confirm status changed
  - Show: "✅ Ticket moved to In Progress"
  - Add comment: "Starting work on this ticket"

#### Option 4: View full ticket details
- Call `jira_search_issues(issueKeys=[ticket], includeComments=true)`
- Display full markdown:
  ```markdown
  # {TICKET}: {Summary}
  
  **Status:** {status}
  **Assignee:** {assignee}
  **Reporter:** {reporter}
  **Priority:** {priority}
  **Story Points:** {points}
  **Created:** {date}
  **Updated:** {date}
  
  ## Description
  {Full description with formatting}
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  {If present in description}
  
  ## Comments ({count})
  {Recent comments, most recent first}
  
  ---
  {author} • {date}
  {comment text}
  ---
  
  [View in Jira](https://jira.intuit.com/browse/{TICKET})
  ```
- After displaying, return to action menu

#### Option 5: Exit
- Show: "👍 Context provided. Happy coding!"
- Exit gracefully

### 10. Error handling and edge cases

#### Ticket not found:
```
❌ Ticket PROJ-1234 not found or not accessible.

Possible reasons:
• Ticket doesn't exist
• You don't have permission to view it
• Ticket key is misspelled

Try: Check ticket exists at https://jira.intuit.com/browse/PROJ-1234
```

#### Already on matching branch:
```
✓ Already on branch: PROJ-1234-add-user-dashboard

Branch status: 2 commits ahead of main, 0 behind
Last commit: Add user dashboard component (3 hours ago)

{Continue with action menu, but note current state}
```

#### Ticket already In Progress:
```
ℹ️ Ticket is already In Progress (assigned to you)

{Show "View available transitions" instead of "Move to In Progress"}
```

#### No git repository:
```
⚠️ Not in a git repository

Ticket context:
{Show ticket details}

Action menu limited to:
1. View full ticket details
2. Move ticket to "In Progress"
3. Exit
```

#### PR search fails (gh not authenticated):
```
⚠️ Cannot search PRs (gh not authenticated)

Ticket and branch context:
{Show ticket and branch info}

{Continue with action menu, skip PR section}
```

## Validation Rules

### Must validate:
- ✅ Ticket key format is valid (`[A-Z]+-\d+`)
- ✅ Ticket exists and is accessible
- ✅ Git commands available (if showing branch info)
- ✅ User confirms before destructive actions

### Graceful degradation:
- ❌ Don't fail if no branches found (show "No branches")
- ❌ Don't fail if PR search fails (show warning, continue)
- ❌ Don't fail if not in git repo (limit features)
- ❌ Don't fail if sprint info missing (skip sprint section)

AI: 📋 FLP-4045: Refactor analytics dashboard
    
    Status: Open | Assignee: Unassigned | Story Points: 13

    Description:
    Major refactor of analytics dashboard to improve
    performance and data loading...
    
    {Rest of context display}
```

## Notes

- **Context-first approach** - Shows all relevant information before asking for action
- **Non-destructive** - Always confirms before making changes
- **Awareness** - Helps avoid duplicate work by showing existing branches/PRs
- **Sprint-aware** - Highlights if ticket is in active sprint
- **Flexible** - Works with or without git repo, with or without PR access
- **Fast execution** - Typical run time 3-5 seconds

## Branch Naming Convention

Default format: `{TICKET}-{kebab-case-description}`

**Examples:**
- `MCAUT-7527-trigger-filter-processing`
- `AORG-7698-add-contact-api-endpoint`
- `EEE-11054-feature-flag-setup`
- `FLP-4045-analytics-dashboard-refactor`

**Rules:**
- No username prefix
- Kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- Remove special characters except hyphens
- Limit description to 50 chars
- Ticket number always first

## Integration with Other Commands

Works well in sequence with:
1. `/work-on PROJ-1234` - Gather context, create branch, move to In Progress
2. *Do work, make commits*
3. `/pr-create-from-commits` - Create PR from work
4. *After PR merged, ticket automatically closed*

- **PR creation**: `.agent/skills/pr-create-from-commits/SKILL.md`
- **Standup**: `.agent/skills/standup/SKILL.md`
- **Git workflows**: `.agent/rules/git-workflows.mdc`

## Changelog

- **v1.1** - Use expand=transitions.fields upfront to discover required screen fields before transitioning; populate with sensible defaults
- **v1.0** - Initial version with context gathering, branch management, and interactive actions
